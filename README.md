# CDN Overview

The [**Shaughnessy CDN**](https://cdn.emmetts.dev) is a private CDN for use only on [**Shaughnessy**](https://shaughnessy.irish) sponsored websites and web-apps. This CDN _does_ include third-party fonts, images, and files that were _neither created_ _nor_ _commissioned_ by the [**Shaughnessy Group**](https://shaughnessy.irish) or its associates.

The [**Shaughnessy CDN**](https://cdn.emmetts.dev) is designed to make [**Shaughnessy**](https://shaughnessy.irish) web-based projects quicker and more responsive by loading a font through a CDN, rather than directly on the web-server.
